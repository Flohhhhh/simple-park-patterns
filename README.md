# simple-park-patterns
A FiveM resource that can be used by vehicle developers to create park patterns using extras.



# Installation

# Config

``speedThreshold`` = below this speed, extras on the vehicle will switch states

``healthThreshold`` = below this vehicle body health, the effect is disabled

``delay`` = time between checks, should not need to be any lower than .5 seconds, higher values may look more realistic

``vehicles`` Example
```{spawnName='police1', pExtras={1,2 }, dExtras={3}},```
