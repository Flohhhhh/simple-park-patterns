-- CONFIG VALUES
Config = {

    useKPH = false,

    -- extras will toggle below this speed
    speedThreshold = 1,

    -- health threshold disables this effect while vehicle is damaged to prevent unrealistic repairs upon crashing
    healthThreshold = 970, -- 999 would disable effect with ANY damage to vehicle, between 850-999 are good values

    -- check if any doors are fully open before executing effect (prevents doors from always snapping shut)
    -- this also works for hood and trunk
    checkDoors = true,

    -- time between checks in seconds
    -- should not need to be any lower than .5 seconds
    -- higher values may look more realistic

    vehicles = {
        -- pExtras = Extras enabled while parked
        -- dExtras = Extras enabled while driving
        -- EXAMPLE {spawnName='helloworld', pExtras={1, 2}, dExtras={3}},
        {spawnName='', pExtras={}, dExtras={}},
